# Build It Bigger

This project is part of [**Android Developer Nanodegree Scholarship Program**](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) by
**Udacity** and **Google**.

The purpose of this project, is to create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

## Features

* App contains free and paid flavors that share code between them
* App factors reusable functionality into a Java library
* App factors reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configures a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Uses the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configures tests that runs against the local App Engine development server
